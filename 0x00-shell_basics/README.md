## Project Overview
This project is designed to help you understand and practice the following concepts:
- Source code management
- Git and GitHub basics
- Creating and managing repositories
- Writing good READMEs
- Collaborating on projects using Git and GitHub

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain what source code management is.
- Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
- Create and manage repositories.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Create branches, merge them, and resolve conflicts.
- Collaborate effectively on GitHub.

---

## Requirements
- A `README.md` file at the root of the `alx-zero_day` repository.
- A `README.md` file in the `0x03-git` directory.
- Use the command line for all Git operations (except when the web UI is necessary).
- Avoid using GitHub’s web UI for tasks that can be done via the command line.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create and Setup Your Git and GitHub Account
1. Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one.
2. Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub.
3. Update your Intranet profile with your GitHub username.
4. Create a repository named `alx-zero_day` with the description: "I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer."
5. Clone the repository to your local machine.
6. Create a `README.md` file with the content "My first readme."
7. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

### Task 1: Repo-session
1. Create a new directory named `0x03-git` in your `alx-zero_day` repository.
2. Add a `README.md` file in both the root directory and the `0x03-git` directory.
3. Commit and push your changes.

### Task 2: Coding Fury Road
1. Create directories: `bash`, `c`, and `js`.
2. Create the following files:
   - `c/c_is_fun.c`
   - `js/main.js`
   - `js/index.js`
   - `bash/alx` (with the content: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "ALX"`)
   - `bash/school` (with the content: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`)
3. Add all files to Git, commit with the message "Starting to code today, so cool," and push to GitHub.

### Task 3: Collaboration is the Base of a Company
1. Create a new branch named `update_script`.
2. In this branch:
   - Create an empty file `bash/98`.
   - Update `bash/alx` to replace `echo "ALX"` with `echo "ALX School"`.
   - Update `bash/school` to replace `echo "School"` with `echo "The school is open!"`.
3. Commit your changes with the message "My personal work" and push the branch.
4. Switch back to the `main` branch:
   - Update `bash/alx` to replace `echo "ALX"` with `echo "ALX School is so cool!"`.
   - Delete the `js` directory.
5. Commit your changes with the message "Hot fix" and push to GitHub.

### Task 4: Collaboration: Be Up to Date
1. Update the `README.md` file in the `main` branch via the GitHub web interface.
2. Pull the changes to your local machine.
3. Create a file named `up_to_date` with the Git command used to pull changes.
4. Add, commit, and push the file with the message "How to be up to date in git."

### Task 5: HAAA What Did You Do???
1. Merge the `update_script` branch into `main`.
2. Resolve any conflicts by keeping the changes from the `update_script` branch.
3. Push the resolved changes to GitHub.

### Task 6: Never Push Too Much
1. Create a `.gitignore` file.
2. Add a rule to ignore `~` files (generated by Emacs).
3. Commit and push the `.gitignore` file.
